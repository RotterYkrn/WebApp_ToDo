# Project Brief: 1Day ToDo Application

## Overview

This project aims to develop a ToDo application focused on planning tasks for the current or next day, rather than long-term scheduling. It is designed for users who prefer to decide their daily tasks on the day itself or the day before.

## Core Requirements

- Allow users to create a daily plan from a main ToDo list and a Habit list.
- Enable adding tasks not present in the main lists to the daily plan.
- Provide a view for the current day's plan.
- Allow reordering of tasks in the daily plan by title, time (if set), or priority.
- Implement a main ToDo list for non-repeating tasks with details like title, deadline, description, priority, category, subtasks, and completion status.
- Implement a Habit list for repeating tasks with details like title, description, category, and an option for automatic inclusion in the daily plan.
- Include a Settings page for general settings (like date change time) and account management (email, password, external account linking).

## Goals

- Create a user-friendly interface for daily task planning.
- Provide flexible options for managing both one-off tasks and habits.
- Ensure data persistence for tasks, habits, and settings.
- Implement necessary backend APIs to support frontend functionality.
- Adhere to specified technical stack and coding conventions (vanilla JS, ESM, JSDoc, tsc, Vite, Express, Prisma, MySQL).
