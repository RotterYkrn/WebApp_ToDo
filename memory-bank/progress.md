# Progress: 1Day ToDo Application

## What Works

- Basic project directory structure is set up.
- Docker Compose configuration exists for setting up the environment (database, server, client).
- Prisma schema and migrations are present and applied.
- Backend APIs for ToDo, Habit, Category, UserSettings, DailyPlan, DailyPlanItem, and Subtasks CRUD operations are implemented in `server/src/app.ts`.
- User authentication APIs (signup, login, logout, check-auth) are implemented.
- Basic server and client entry files (`server/src/server.mjs`, `client/src/scripts/main.mjs`, `client/src/index.html`) exist.
- Code formatting/linting tools (Biome, ESLint, Prettier) are configured, though consistency needs confirmation.
- Memory Bank core files have been initialized and updated.

## What's Left to Build

- **Core Features (based on `docs/document.md`):**
    - Daily Plan creation logic (selecting from lists, adding new) - **Backend API exists, Frontend UI/Logic needed.**
    - Daily Plan display and reordering functionality - **Backend API exists, Frontend UI/Logic needed.**
    - ToDo list management (CRUD, properties) - **Backend API exists, Frontend UI/Logic needed.**
    - Habit list management (CRUD, properties, auto-include logic) - **Backend API exists, Frontend UI/Logic needed.**
    - Settings page implementation (general, account) - **Backend API exists, Frontend UI/Logic needed.**
    - User authentication and authorization - **Backend API exists, Frontend UI/Logic needed.**
- **Frontend UI:** Build the user interface components and pages to consume the implemented APIs.
- **Database Schema:** Refine and potentially expand the Prisma schema based on detailed requirements (if needed).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling on the frontend and refine on the backend.
- **Testing:** Add unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.
- **Documentation:** Further develop project documentation beyond the initial `docs/document.md` and Memory Bank.

## Current Status

The backend APIs for core features and authentication are largely implemented. The primary remaining work is the implementation of the frontend user interface and logic to interact with these APIs, as well as comprehensive error handling and testing.

## Known Issues

- Consistency of code formatting/linting tools needs to be verified and enforced.
- Detailed requirements for some features (e.g., specific settings options, authentication flow details) may need further clarification during frontend implementation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial decision to use vanilla JS, ESM, JSDoc, tsc, Vite, Express, Prisma, MySQL is established.
- Decision to use Docker Compose for environment management is made and implemented.
- Decision to initialize Memory Bank for context management has been executed and is being maintained.
- Backend APIs for core features have been implemented ahead of the initial plan.
