# Active Context: 1Day ToDo Application

## Current Work Focus

Initializing the project context by creating the necessary Memory Bank files based on the provided `docs/document.md` and project structure.

## Recent Changes

- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/techContext.md`.

## Next Steps

1. Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
2. Read all Memory Bank files to fully load the project context.
3. Based on the loaded context and the user's request to "develop this application", formulate a development plan in PLAN MODE.
4. Present the plan to the user using `plan_mode_respond`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Need to clarify the primary code formatter/linter to use for the entire project, as both Biome, ESLint, and Prettier configurations exist. `.clinerules` specifies Biome for frontend and ESLint for backend, which will be followed.
- The initial task is broad ("develop this application"). The plan needs to break this down into smaller, manageable steps, likely starting with setting up the development environment and implementing core data models/APIs.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Adhere to vanilla JS, ESM, JSDoc, and tsc for type checking.
- Follow the specified directory structure.
- Use Docker Compose for the development environment.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is in its early stages, with basic file structure and some configuration (`docker-compose.yaml`, initial Prisma schema, basic server/client files).
- Memory Bank was not initialized, requiring initial setup.
